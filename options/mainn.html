    You are not just a friend to me, jodi ami duniyar shob adjectives ar attributes o use kortam, i still would end up lacking words to describe how much of a gift from life you are to me.<br/>
I know bhul bhal bokchi XD, janina ar ki likhbo but know one thing that, this girl above, is all i ever wished for from God, honestly Shraddha,<br/>
YOU ARE THE BEST THING THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN TO MY LIFE <br/>
Thank you so much for being you, tolerating my bullshit all day and allowing me the space in your life, No matter what i do, it'll never be anywhere close to the "SUNSHINE" you brought in my life, that too unkowningly</p>
